Most of the collection objects that are returned from functions that
make http requests to okcupid.com library are instances of
:class:`~okcupyd.util.fetchable.Fetchable`. In most cases, it is fine
to treat these objects as though they are lists. It is possible to
iterate over them, slice them and access them by index:

.. code:: python

   for question in user.profile.questions:
       print(question.answer.text)

   a_random_question = user.profile.questions[2]
   for question in questions[2:4]:
       print(question.answer_options[0])

However, in some cases, it is important to understand that 
objects are not, in fact, lists.
:class:`~okcupyd.util.fetchable.Fetchable` instances make the http
requests that are needed to construct its contents as its contents are
requested. The :attr:`~okcupyd.profile.Profile.questions`
:class:`~okcupyd.util.fetchable.Fetchable` that is used in the example
above fetches the pages that are used to construct its contents in
batches of 10 questions on an as needed basis. This means that the
actual call to retrieve data is made when iteration starts. If you
enable the request logger when you run this code snippet, you get
output that illustrates this fact:

.. code::

Some fetchables will continue fetching content for quite a long time.
The search fetchable, for example, will fetch content until okcupid runs
out of search results. As such, things like:

.. code:: python

    for profile in user.search():
        profile.message("hey!")

should be avoided, as they are likely to generate a massive number of requests
to okcupid.com.



Another subtlety of the :class:`~okcupyd.util.fetchable.Fetchable`
class is that its instances cache its contained results. This means that
the second iteration over :attr:`okcupyd.profile.Profile.questions` in the
example below does not result in any http requests:

.. code:: python

    for question in user.profile.questions:
        print(question.text)

    for question in user.profile.questions:
        print(question.answer)

It is important to understand that this means that the contents of a
:class:`~okcupyd.util.fetchable.Fetchable`
i.e their contents may be out
of sync with the current state of okcupid.com. Simply calling the
:class:`~okcupyd.util.fetchable.Fetchable`
will cause it to request new data from okcupid.com when its contents are
requested. The code snippet that follows prints out all the questions that
the logged in user has answered roughly once per hour, including ones that
are answered while the program is running.

.. code:: python

    import time

    while True:
        for question in user.profile.questions:
            print(question.text)
        user.profile.questions()
        time.sleep(3600)

If the `user.profile.questions()` call were not there, this program would print
the same thing over and over again.
